        <h1>Fun Facts About Adobo</h1>

        <p class="intro">
            Adobo is more than just a popular Filipino dish—it carries history, culture, 
            and tradition in every bite. Here are some interesting facts that make adobo 
            one of the most loved foods in the Philippines.
        </p>

        <div class="fact-card">
            <h3>Ancient Filipino Roots</h3>
            <p>
                Long before the Spanish arrived, indigenous Filipinos were already 
                preserving meat by cooking it in vinegar and salt. This method 
                helped food last longer in the tropical climate and became the 
                foundation of modern adobo.

            <h3>A Spanish Name, But Not a Spanish Dish</h3>
            <p>
                The term “adobo” was given by Spanish colonizers because the dish 
                reminded them of their own marinade. However, the cooking technique 
                existed centuries earlier, making it truly Filipino.

            <h3>The Unofficial National Dish</h3>
            <p>
                While the Philippines has no official national dish, adobo is widely 
                recognized as the country’s culinary symbol because of its popularity 
                and simplicity.

                <em>adobong puti</em>, spicy adobo, sweet adobo, and even
